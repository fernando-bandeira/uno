# uno
UNO game developed in Python. This was one of my fist projects ever built in Python. Even though it uses only the console screen, it was quite a challenge to apply the knowledges that I've obtained studying the language in a real project.

It's simple, but certainly a nice case of use of almost all basic features of Python.
